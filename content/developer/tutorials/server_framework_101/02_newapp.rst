Install the app
===============

If you followed the :doc:`setup guide <../setup_guide>` carefully, you should now have a running
Odoo server with the `odoo/tutorials` repository in the `addons-path`, and be logged in as an
administrator.

**Let's install our real estate app!** In your browser, open Odoo and navigate to
:menuselection:`Apps`. Search for :guilabel:`Real Estate` and click :guilabel:`Activate`.

Nothing has changed? That's normal; the `real_estate` module we just installed is currently an empty
shell. It only contains two files:

- An empty :file:`__init__.py` file to make Python treat the :file:`real_estate` directory as a
  package.
- The :file:`__manifest__.py` file that declares the :file:`real_estate` Python package as an Odoo
  module.

Those two files are the minimum requirements for a directory to be considered as an Odoo module.

.. exercise::
   Search for each key of our :file:`__manifest__.py` file in the :ref:`reference documentation
   <reference/module/manifest>` and understand the base metadata that defines our module.

Create the first model
======================

Now that our module is recognized by Odoo, it's time to build towards the business features. Data is
essential for any real-world application, and our real estate module won't be an exception.

To store data effectively, we need two things: a way to define the structure of that data, and a
system to store and manipulate it. Fortunately, the server framework of Odoo comes equipped with the
perfect tool: the :abbr:`ORM (Object Relational Mapper)` layer.

The ORM simplifies data access and manipulation by allowing you to define **models**. Models act as
blueprints for your data; they define the structure and organization of information within your
module. You can see them as templates that specify what kind of data your module will handle. For
example, real estate properties, owners, or tenants.

Each model is made of smaller components called **fields**. You can see them as the individual
characteristics that describe your data. Fields allow you to define the relevant data your
application needs to capture and manage. In the case of real estate properties, some example fields
could be: the property name, the type (house, apartment, etc.), the floor area...

In Odoo, models are represented by Python classes that inherit from the `models.Model` class
provided by the ORM. Within these model classes, fields are defined as class attributes. Fields come
in a variety of types like `String`, `Float`, `Boolean`, and more.
